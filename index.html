            <p>
                    The general idea behind this brief is that we need to update the code 
                    to ensure that all changes are synchronized. One important thing that we wanted to 
                    add were some features that swim.io uses. Specifically their feature that ensures that the 
                    code is in sync. Another issue that we wanted to address was the messages that a person would 
                    receive regarding the code being out of date. 
            </p>

        <div class="flow">
            <h3>Flow 1: Student A</h3>
            <div class="flow1">
                <img src="Screenshot 2024-04-23 at 1.35.33 PM.png" />

                <p>
                    The purpose of this flow is to illustrate what happens when a user chooses to
                    update the outdated code. Specifically this flow follows what happend when a student selects 'reselect'
                    in the code update box. Ultimately thr user will then be taken to a screen where the rest of the page is greyed out and the 
                    code would be highlited. Users can then update this code, which goes back to the main screen, this time updating the code update box to verifying.
                    finally, when updated, the update code block says up to date and the notification on the top of the file turns green indicating everything is consistent. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Flow 2: Student A</h3>
            <div class="flow2">
                <img src="Screenshot 2024-04-23 at 1.34.16 PM.png" />
                <i class="bi bi-arrow-right"></i>

                <p>
                    The purpose of this flow is to illustrate what happens when a user clicks on the update button. again just like the previous flow the entirety of the 
                    page is greyed out except for the updates section. The update section lists the changes and outdated code. The user then has the ability to select on the outdated
                    code, which will then take them to the code update block with that particular code as its snippet.

            <h3>LoFi Design</h3>
            <p>
                The main implementation of the LoFi Design for the Dynamic Docs is the inclusion of the code block that contains both the suggested code 
                and the out of date code. At the top of the page the user has an alert message that tells them the status of their code, to see if it needs to be updated. In 
                addition to these areas we also marked areas in the repo file tree that indicates which files have been altered and need to be updated. We ensured that the personal notes page includes markings that indicate areas where the code 
                may be inconsistent in the code base. It also includes a learge alert at the top of the page indicating the there is some inconsistency
                in the code, however this alert is less informative.
